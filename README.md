If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact.

GENERAL INFO:

* This application was developed using the knowledge and libraries obtained from the 'Android Applications with Kotlin & Java' course, which was offered by the 'C and Systems Programmers Association' and taught by Oguz Karan.

* The application uses a Veterinary Service developed with Java. If there is a problem in accessing this service or to see the codes related to the service, please contact me.

FEATURES:

* The application has been developed in accordance with the layered architecture design, divided into modules as Repository, Service, and Veterinarian libraries.

* The application has two main options (Save & Get).

* To save a veterinarian by accessing the Java service, you can enter their diploma number, citizenship number, name, surname, and date of birth.

* You can obtain the total number of veterinarians added in the Get service (Get -> Count).

* In the Get service, you can search for added veterinarians by surname, month and year information, or year range information.

* For the veterinarians searched in the 'Find By Last Name' service, it is possible to retrieve the information from the cache, reconnect to the service, or add to the local database created using SQLite.

* Dependency injection (Hilt) has been implemented at all stages of the application.

* Retrofit technology is used to access the Java service.

* The application uses DataBinding for most of the UI elements.

* After the data received from the service provider is saved in the local database, you can use a database management tool that supports SQLite (such as DBeaver) to access and read the saved data in the database.

* Gradle is used as the build tool.

WEAKNESSES:

* Since the focus of the application is on the backend code, less attention was paid to the UI/UX design.
